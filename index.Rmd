I am a recent graduate from University of Colorado, where I studied sustainable
planning and management in the Masters of the Environment program. I am currently in the 
process of applying for jobs, but first I need to create a portfolio for my data analytics
projects. If you're seeing this, this page is a work in progress! :)
